# Date: 2025-08-06
# Based on the implementation in the linkcup SillyTavern extension.

# --- Bluetooth Service & Characteristics ---

- Service UUID: 6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e
- Write Characteristic UUID: 6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e
- Notify Characteristic UUID: 6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e

# --- Message Type Definitions ---

A summary of the message `type` values used in communication.

- `1`: [BLE -> APP] UUID Information
- `2`: [APP -> BLE] Acknowledgement (ACK)
- `4`: [BLE -> APP] MAC Address Information
- `5`: [BLE -> APP] Firmware Version Information
- `7`: [BLE -> APP] Real-time Data Packet (Legacy format)
- `11`: [BLE -> APP] Key Press Event
- `13`: [APP -> BLE] Event Command (e.g., Re-center)
- `14`: [BLE -> APP] Real-time Data Packet (Current format)

# --- Communication Flow ---

## 1. Connection & Handshake

Upon establishing a Bluetooth connection, a three-step handshake is required before real-time data is sent.

**Step 1: UUID**
- BLE sends UUID.
  - `{"type": 1, "uuid": "..."}`
- APP responds with ACK.
  - `{"type": 2, "ack": 1}`

**Step 2: MAC Address**
- BLE sends MAC Address.
  - `{"type": 4, "mac": "..."}`
- APP responds with ACK.
  - `{"type": 2, "ack": 2}`

**Step 3: Firmware Version**
- BLE sends Firmware Version.
  - `{"type": 5, "version": "...", "maxV": 18}`
- APP responds with ACK.
  - `{"type": 2, "ack": 3}`

After the third ACK is sent, the handshake is complete. The APP will display a "Connected" status.

## 2. Data Transmission (BLE -> APP)

Once the handshake is complete, the device sends real-time data.

**Real-time Data (`type: 7` or `type: 14`)**
- The device sends a continuous stream of data packets. The extension handles both type 7 and type 14.
- **Payload Example (`type: 14`):**
  ```json
  {
      "type": 14,
      "value": {
          "v": [0],       // Thrust intensity (0-18)
          "p": 5,         // Position ID (1-10)
          "Yaw": 123.87,
          "Pitch": 1.44,
          "Roll": -1.89
      }
  }
  ```
- **Note:** The `v` value is an array, the code currently uses the first element `v[0]`.

**Key Press Event (`type: 11`)**
- Sent when the physical button on the device is pressed.
- **Payload:**
  - `{"type": 11, "k": 1}`

## 3. Commands (APP -> BLE)

The application can send commands to the device.

**Re-center/Reset Yaw Command (`type: 13`)**
- Sent when the user clicks the '🔁' button in the UI.
- **Payload:**
  - `{"type": 13, "mode": 2}`
